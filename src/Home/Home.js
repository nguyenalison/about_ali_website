          <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio! I recently graduated from Seattle University with a Bachelor's in Science with a degree in Computer Science. </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>The last 4th years have been the most transformative years of my life. I entered college and ... I learned how to show up and take space in a new place. I learned how to navigate the world under a pandemic. I learned how to be in community with people under such circumstances. I learned how to code. I learned how ambitious I could be. I learned how much I love working and collaborating with others. I learned that change excites me. Iâ€™ve learned to be intentional about the spaces I spend my time in. </p>
